# cosmosim-lambdaCDM
A high-performance 3D ΛCDM N-body simulator in C++20. Implements Barnes–Hut tree gravity in comoving coordinates with Hubble expansion, OpenMP parallelization, and snapshot output. Designed as a foundation for extending into TreePM, MPI scaling, and cosmological initial condition generation.
